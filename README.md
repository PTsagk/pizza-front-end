# Pizza Website (front-end)


This is a website for a fake pizzeria where the customers can see and order from a variety of pizzas and many other type of foods and drinks. This website uses typescript and it is connected to a **Node js** backend (you can find it here https://github.com/PTsagk/pizza-back-end) with a **mySQL** database. In this site customers can create an account and make orders, view past orders and manage their addresses. There is also and admin panel where the admin can be notified when new orders are placed from the customers and notify the customers about the progress of their order.
